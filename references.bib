@inproceedings{DSouza2001,
abstract = {Real-time control of the end-effector of a humanoid robot in external coordinates requires computationally efficient solutions of the inverse kinematics problem. In this context, this paper investigates inverse kinematics learning for resolved motion rate control (RMRC) employing an optimization criterion to resolve kinematic redundancies. Our learning approach is based on the key observations that learning an inverse of a nonuniquely invertible function can be accomplished by augmenting the input representation to the inverse model and by using a spatially localized learning approach. We apply this strategy to inverse kinematics learning and demonstrate how a recently developed statistical learning algorithm, locally weighted projection regression, allows efficient learning of inverse kinematic mappings in an incremental fashion even when input spaces become rather high dimensional. Our results are illustrated with a 30-DOF humanoid robot},

abstract = {Robotic operations are one of the major maintenance challenges for ITER and future fusion reactors. In particular, in-vessel inspection operations without loss of conditioning will be mandatory. In this context, an Articulated Inspection Arm (AIA) is currently developed by the CEA within the European work programme framework, which aims at demonstrating the feasibility of a multi-purpose in-vessel Remote Handling inspection system using a long reach, limited payload carrier (up to 10 kg). It is composed of 5 segments with 8 degrees of freedom and a total range of 8 m. The first in situ tests will take place by the end of 2007 on the Tore Supra Tokamak at Cadarache (France). They will validate concepts for operations under ITER relevant vacuum and temperature conditions. After qualification, the arm will constitute a promising tool for various applications. Several processes are already considered for ITER maintenance and will be demonstrated on the AIA robot carrier: • The first embedded process is the viewing system. It is already manufactured and will allow close visual inspection of the complex Plasma Facing Components (PFC) (limiters, neutralisers, RF antenna, diagnostic windows, etc.). • In situ localisation of water leakage based on a helium sniffing system is also being studied to improve and facilitate maintenance operations. • Finally a laser ablation system for PFC detritiation, developed in CEA laboratories, is being fitted to be implemented on the robot for future operation in Tore Supra. This paper deals with the integration of the robot into Tore Supra and the progress in the development of the processes listed above. It also describes the current test campaign aiming to qualify the robot performance and reliability under vacuum and temperature conditions.},

abstract = {Robotic operations are one of the major maintenance challenges for ITER and future fusion reactors. CEA has developed a multipurpose carrier able to realize deployments in the plasma vessel without breaking the Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) and temperature conditioning. A 6 years R\&D programme was jointly conducted by CEA-LIST Interactive Robotics Unit and the Institute for Magnetic Fusion Research (IRFM) in order to demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of an in-vessel inspection robot relevant to ITER requirements. The Articulated Inspection Arm robot (AIA) is an 8-m long multilink carrier with a payload up to 10 kg operable between plasma under tokamak conditioning environment; its geometry allows a complete close inspection of Plasma Facing Components (PFCs) of the Tore Supra vessel. Different tools are being developed by CEA to be plugged at the front head of the carrier. The diagnostic presently in operation consists in a viewing system offering accurate visual inspection of PFCs. Leak detection of first wall based on helium sniffing and laser compact system for carbon co-deposited layers characterizations or treatments are also considered for demonstration. In April 2008, the AIA robot equipped with its vision diagnostic has realized a complete deployment into Tore Supra and the first closed inspection of the vessel under UHV conditions. During the upcoming experimental campaign, the same operation will be performed under relevant conditions (10-6 Pa and 120 °C) after a conditioning phase at 200 °C to avoid outgassing pollution of the chamber. This paper describes the different steps of the project development, robot capabilities with the present operations conducted on Tore Supra and future requirements for making the robot a tool for tokamak routine operation.},

@article{Hecht2006,
abstract = {Abstract Multimodal virtual environments (VE) succeed better than single-sensory technologies in creating a sense of presence. We hypothesize that the underlying cognitive mechanism is related to a faster mental processing of multimodal events. Comparing simple detection times of unimodal (auditory, visual, and haptic) events, with bimodal and trimodal combinations, we show that mental processing times are in the following order: unimodal > bimodal > trimodal. Given this processing-speed advantage, multimodal VE users start their cognitive process faster, thus, in a similar exposure time they can pay attention to more informative cues and subtle details in the environment and integrate them creatively. This richer, more complete and coherent experience may contribute to an enhanced sense of presence.},

The AIA robot with a vision diagnostic has been deployed inside the vacuum-vessel of Tore Supra tokamak and has realized closed inspections of plasma facing components’ under relevant conditions (high vacuum and temperature). CEA is engaged in development of interchangeable diagnostics or tools to be plugged on the front head of the arm. This covers applications such as in-vessel inspections, water leak localization, Plasma Facing Components (PFCs) characterization and treatment. This paper describes R\&D activities performed in CEA laboratories to develop diagnostics and tools for in-vessel interventions. The AIA multipurpose carrier to carry such devices is also presented. The first demonstration of a quick intervention for plasma facing components performed in the Tore Supra Facility is described as well.},

abstract = {In 2008, the Articulated Inspection Arm (AIA) performed its first deployment in Tore Supra tokamak vessel, under real vacuum and temperature conditions (10-6 Pa and 120 °C) after a conditioning phase to avoid pollution of the chamber. This full demonstration is a turning point in the project, allowing a second phase to start toward the objective to make use of the Remote Handling Equipment as an inspection routine tool. This feasibility demonstration will also be performed on Tore Supra. At this stage, the system requires enhancements of overall technologies and also developments of the Remote Handling control system. Lessons learned in the first phase of the project and experience collected for more than 20 years by Robotics Units of CEA-LIST teams on teleoperated systems enable to identify three main fields to explore to reach the objectives: • Development of a reliable control based on a real time generic command control system. • Development of a graphical supervisor for intuitive steering. • Development of a generic flexible model for realistic computations of the robot localization in the environment. This paper is dedicated to the description of the further developments that shall be done for routine Remote Handling operations. It presents the R\&D project roadmap for the next years.},

abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds},

@article{Martinez2005,
abstract = {A fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition is to determine where and, most importantly, why a given technique is applicable. This is not only necessary because it helps us decide which techniques to apply at each given time. Knowing why current algorithms cannot be applied facilitates the design of new algorithms robust to such problems. In this paper, we report on a theoretical study that demonstrates where and why generalized eigen-based linear equations do not work. In particular, we show that when the smallest angle between the ith eigenvector given by the metric to be maximized and the first i eigenvectors given by the metric to be minimized is close to zero, our results are not guaranteed to be correct. Several properties of such models are also presented. For illustration, we concentrate on the classical applications of classification and feature extraction. We also show how we can use our findings to design more robust algorithms. We conclude with a discussion on the broader impacts of our results.},

abstract = {Digital low-pass differentiation is often required in processing various biological or biomechanical data. However, both the nature of biological signals and the use of micro-or minicomputers in such applications imply the need for simple, low-order, and fast differentiation methods, rather than sophisticated high-order algorithms. Responding to this need, we investigate here the low-pass first- and second-order digital differentiation from both theoretical and practical points of view, in order to achieve good and simple algorithms. In contrast with most of the research works previously done in this field, whose main aim was to achieve better accuracy even in the cost of using quite high-order algorithms, we restrict ourselves in this study only to low orders, being interested not only in the accuracy achieved, but also in the simplicity of the algorithm. After discussing the theoretical considerations concerning our optimum low-pass differentiation filters, we present our simple low-order filters and show them to be not only very convenient for use, but also almost optimum.},
